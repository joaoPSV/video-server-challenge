# Video Server Challenge
Design a server that handles HTTP requests based on the following specifications:
1. User management: The server should be able to register and authenticate users.
User has: username, password, and an optional mobile_token (string)
Required routes:
- Get users (no auth required): returns a list of all users
- Get users (no auth required): takes a username and return the user with
matching username
- Register (no auth required): takes a username, password and optional string for
mobile_token. Registers the user and authenticates the client as the newly created user
- Sign in/authenticate: takes a username and password, and authenticates the
user
- Update User (must be signed in as the user): updates password and/or
mobile_token of the user
- Delete User (must be signed in as the user): deletes the user
1. Room management: The server should be able to handle creating conference rooms
Room has: name (non-unique), guid, host user, participants (users) in the room, and a
capacity limit. Number of users in the room must not exceed the capacity
Required routes:
- Create a room (signed in as a user): creates a room hosted by the current user,
with an optional capacity limit. Default is 5.
- Change host (must be signin as the host): changes the host of the user from the
current user to another user
- Join/leave (signed in as a user): joins/leaves the room as the current user
- Get info (no auth): given a room guid, gets information about a room
- Search for the rooms that a user is in: given a username, returns a list of rooms
that the user is in.
NOTES:
- Express + TypeScript is preferred, but feel free to implement in a framework youâ€™re familiar
with as well
- This spec is not comprehensive. Feel free to add any custom behaviour (or assumptions
about user input) if they are not specified in the spec. But please do document these
behaviours.
- The server DOES NOT need to persist anything between runs. You can store everything in
memory if you want (bonus points for persistence of the data)
